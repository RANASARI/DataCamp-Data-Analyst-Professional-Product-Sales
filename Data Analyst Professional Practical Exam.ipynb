No cleaning is needed.\n\nAfter the data validation, the dataset contains **13924 rows and 8 columns** without missing values.\n\n## How many customers were there for each approach?\n\n![1](1.jpg)\n\nFrom the record of the last 6 weeks, nearly half of the sales were made through the 'Email' sales method, followed by the 'Call' sales method. Additionally, it's evident that the number of sales with the 'Email' sales method is nearly one and a half times the number of sales with the 'Call' sales method. \n\n## What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?\n\nWe want to examine the distribution of revenue from the last 6 weeks. Upon reviewing the revenue distribution, it appears that the majority of the revenue falls within the 40-110 range. The distribution is most concentrated between 40-55 and 80-95 specifically.\n\n![2](2.jpg)\n\n\nThe bar chart below shows the distribution of total revenue by sales methods. 51.4% of the revenue is generated through the 'Email' sales method, 31.2% through the 'Email + Call' sales method, and finally, 17.4% through the 'Call' sales method.\n\n![5](5.jpg)\n\n\nBased on the multiple boxplots below, we observe that the revenue range in the 'Email + Call' sales method is more pronounced compared to other sales methods. The majority of the revenue generated through the 'Email + Call' method falls within the range of 156 to 191, which is higher than that of 'Email' and 'Call'.\n\n![3](3.jpg)\n\nBy examining these boxplots, it becomes evident that the 'Call' sales method was the least productive. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the majority of revenue amounts for the 'Call' sales method fall within the range of 41-53, which is significantly lower than the ranges for the other sales methods. This clarifies why 'Call' contributed the smallest percentage (17.4%) to the total revenue.\n\n![4](4.jpg)\n\n## Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?\n\n![6](6.jpg)\n\nWhen we look the revenue by week and sales method, we observe that in the first week, revenue was significantly higher through the 'Email' sales method compared to other sales methods. However, the 'Email' sales method consistently experienced a decline over the 6-week period, becoming the least revenue-generating method by the 6th week. Although the 'Call' sales method showed a slight improvement over the 6-week period, it remained at roughly the same revenue level by the end of the 6th week. \n\nThe noteworthy observation from the line chart above is that the 'Email + Call' sales method, which generated the lowest revenue in the first week, reached the top by the end of the 6th week.\n\n\n## Which sales method would you recommend continuing to use?\n\nWhen examining the average revenue for each sales method by week, we can observe that the mean revenue for the 'Email + Call' sales method starts at the highest point, whereas the 'Call' sales method generates the lowest mean revenue.\n\n![7](7.jpg)\n\nWhen we analyze all the data, we conclude that the 'Call' sales method is the least efficient sales method. Not only does it contribute the least in terms of revenue, but it also requires team members to spend 30 minutes per customer. It appears to be a cumbersome sales method and, as we can see from the charts, the least efficient.\n\nThe 'Email' sales method holds a significant position in both revenue distribution and requires minimal workload for the team. However, over the six-week period, the revenue generated through the 'Email' sales method has declined. \n\nIn light of this situation, we should use the 'Email + Call' sales method. Sending product information emails to customers first, followed by a call from our sales team a week later to discuss their needs and how this new product can support their business has proven to yield the highest sales.\n\n![8](8.jpg)\n\n![9](9.jpg)\n\nAs seen in the chart and data table above, the revenue generated from 2,223 sales using the 'Email + Call' sales method amounts to 408,257 USD. On the other hand, the revenue from 6,921 sales using the 'Email' sales method totals 672,221 USD. If we increase the number of sales made through the 'Email + Call' method, we can potentially achieve significantly higher revenue compared to other sales methods. At the same time, we should focus on increasing the revenue range of sales made through the 'Email' sales method.\n\n## Business Metric\n\nSince our objective is to enhance revenue using the most effective sales method, I would recommend using the average revenue for each sales method by week as our metric.\n\nBased on our data from the last 6 weeks, 31.2% of the revenue is generated through the 'Email + Call' sales method. Therefore, if this percentage increases in the coming weeks, it would be a very positive indicator toward achieving our goal.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nFor the following weeks, I would recommend we can focus on the following steps:\n\n- **Prioritize 'Email + Call':** Focus on expanding the successful 'Email + Call' method, which consistently increased revenue over six weeks.\n- **Optimize 'Email' Sales:** Improve the 'Email' method due to a declining trend, considering email content, targeting, and timing enhancements.\n- **Continuous Monitoring:** Keep a close eye on each method's performance with weekly tracking to guide informed decisions.\n- **Research and Innovation:** Explore factors contributing to the 'Email + Call' method's success and remain open to new sales strategies.\n- **Feedback Loop:** Establish a feedback loop with the sales team to adapt strategies based on customer responses and challenges.\n- **Set Growth Targets:** Define clear growth targets for each method and regularly assess progress to stay motivated.\n- **Data Quality:** Ensure data accuracy and completeness to support ongoing analysis and decision-making. Improve data quality by addressing missing values, especially in the revenue column.","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":false}},"id":"c22f7f5b-2a69-4515-8b29-7b0e94829f11","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
